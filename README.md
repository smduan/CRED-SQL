# CRED-SQL
This is the official repository for the paper "CRED-SQL: Enhancing Real-world Large Scale Database Text-to-SQL Parsing through Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description". CRED-SQL is a Text-to-SQL framework designed for large-scale databases that addresses the semantic mismatch between natural language questions and SQL queries through Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description.

### Core Challenges
Traditional Text-to-SQL approaches face two major challenges in real-world large-scale scenarios:
Schema Mismatch: In databases with thousands of tables, existing retrieval techniques struggle to accurately identify relevant tables and columns
Semantic Deviation: Direct mapping from natural language questions to SQL queries involves significant semantic gaps

### Innovative Solutions
CRED-SQL overcomes these limitations through a two-stage approach:
#### üîÑ Cluster-based Large-scale Schema Retrieval (CLSR)
* Clusters tables and columns based on semantic similarity
* Dynamic attribute-weighting strategy that boosts relevant attributes
* Significantly improves schema selection accuracy in large-scale databases

#### üìù Execution Description Language (EDL)
* Novel natural language intermediate representation describing SQL execution intent
* Decomposes Text-to-SQL into Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL subtasks
* Better leverages LLMs' general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic deviation
